# GraphQL API with Apollo Server

This README provides documentation for a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server that manages users and demonstrates core GraphQL concepts.

# Project Overview

This project implements a GraphQL API using Apollo Server that provides functionality for:

- Querying users (individual and collections)
- Creating, updating, and deleting users
- Real-time data subscriptions (mentioned in comments)

# GraphQL Core Concepts

1. _Schema_ Definition (TypeDefs): The schema defines the structure of your API using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL). It includes types, fields, and relationships between them.

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
  isAdmin: Boolean!
}

type Query {
  getUsers: [User]
  getUserById(id: ID!): User
}

type Mutation {
  createUser(name: String!, email: String!, isAdmin: Boolean!): User
  updateUser(id: ID!, name: String, email: String, isAdmin: Boolean): User
  deleteUser(id: ID!): User
}
```

2. _Resolvers_ (Resolvers): Resolvers define how to fetch data for each field in the schema. They handle the logic to retrieve data from the data source (e.g., a database).

```graphql
    const resolvers = {
      Query: {
        getUsers: () => {
          <!-- // Logic to fetch all users -->
          return users;
        },
        getUserById: (_, args) => {
          <!-- // Logic to fetch a single user by ID -->
          return users.find(user => user.id === args.id);
        }
      },
      Mutation: {
        createUser: (_, args) => {
          <!-- // Logic to create a new user -->
          const newUser = {
            id: String(users.length + 1),
            name: args.name,
            email: args.email,
            isAdmin: args.isAdmin
          };
          users.push(newUser);
          return newUser;
        },
        <!-- // Other mutation resolvers... -->
      }
    }
```

3. _Queries_ and _Mutations_: Queries are used to fetch data, while mutations are used to modify data.

4. _Subscriptions_: Subscriptions allow clients to subscribe to real-time updates from the server.

type Subscription {
userCreated: User
userUpdated: User
}

5. _Data Sources_: Data sources are responsible for fetching data from a particular source (e.g., a database). They are used by resolvers to retrieve data.

6. _Context_: The context object is shared across all resolvers and allows you to pass information between resolvers (e.g., authentication information).

7. _Directives_: Directives are used to modify the behavior of a field or query. They can be used to conditionally include or exclude fields, validate arguments, and more.

8. _Fragments_: Fragments allow you to define reusable units of fields that can be included in multiple queries.

9. _Error Handling_: Error handling is an important part of any API. GraphQL provides a way to return errors in a consistent format.

10. _Pagination_: Pagination is used to retrieve a subset of data from a larger dataset. It is commonly used to improve performance and reduce the amount of data transferred over the network.

11. _Authentication and Authorization_: Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, while authorization is the process of determining what a user can and cannot access. GraphQL provides ways to implement both authentication and authorization in your API.

12. _Testing_: Testing is an important part of building a reliable API. GraphQL provides tools and best practices for testing your API.

13. _Performance_: Performance is a critical aspect of any API. GraphQL provides ways to optimize your API for performance, including batching requests, caching data, and more.

14. _Security_: Security is a critical aspect of any API. GraphQL provides ways to secure your API, including authentication and authorization, input validation, and more.

15. _Scalability_: Scalability is a critical aspect of any API. GraphQL provides ways to scale your API, including caching data, using a CDN, and more.

16. _Monitoring_: Monitoring is an important part of maintaining a reliable API. GraphQL provides tools and best practices for monitoring your API.

17. _Versioning_: Versioning is an important part of maintaining backward compatibility in your API. GraphQL provides ways to version your API, including using interfaces, unions, and more.

18. _Documentation_: Documentation is an important part of building a reliable API. GraphQL provides ways to document your API, including using SDL, comments, and more.

# Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies:

```ts
npm install @apollo/server graphql
```

2. Run the server:

```ts
node index.js
```

3. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:4000 to access the GraphQL Playground.

# Example Queries

# Fetch All Users

```ts
query {
  getUsers {
    id
    name
    email
    isAdmin
  }
}
```

# Fetch User by ID

```ts
query {
  getUserById(id: "1") {
    id
    name
    email
    isAdmin
  }
}
```

# Create User

```ts
mutation {
  createUser(name: "John Doe", email: "
  john@example.com", isAdmin: true) {
    id
    name
    email
    isAdmin
  }
}
```

# Update User

```ts
mutation {
  updateUser(id: "1", name: "Jane Doe") {
    id
    name
    email
    isAdmin
  }
}
```

# Delete User

```ts
mutation {
    deleteUser(id: "1") {
        id
        name
        email
        isAdmin
    }
}
```

# Best Practices

- Input Types: Use dedicated input types for complex mutation arguments
- Non-nullable Fields: Mark required fields with !
- Descriptive Naming: Use clear, descriptive names for types and fields
- Field-level Resolvers: Implement resolvers for handling relationships
- Error Handling: Implement proper error handling in resolvers
